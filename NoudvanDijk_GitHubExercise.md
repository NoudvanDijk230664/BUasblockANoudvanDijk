The first chatbot ELIZA&nbsp;

Before we had chatbots like ChatGPT and Bing there was a different chatbot called ELIZA. ELIZA was the first program that allowed conversation between humans and machines that was kind of plausible. The ELIZA chatbot was released in 1966 by MIT computer scientist Joseph Weizenbaum. It was a simple process: The speech input would be rephrased by ELIZA given in the form of a question. The thing about the ELIZA chatbot was that the creator was troubled by the reactions of its users. The reason was that Joseph Weizenbaum didn't intend to make a chatbot where people were entranced, engaging in long, deep, and private conversations. After all, the program was only capable of reflecting users' words back to them. He designed it for the exact opposite reason. The opposite reason was to demonstrate how superficial the state of human-to-machine conversation was.
